# Objectives of the Exercise.


-   To systematically list and capture key geographic, demographic, social and health indicators across all households in each village.

-   To define village boundaries to facilitate generation of shape files by collecting GPS points around all village boundaries.

-   To establish the household coverage in the villages where LG operates.

-   To conduct a validation of attended priority households against all priority households in the community.

-   To capture relevant points of interest (POI) in each community including the location of VHT and relevant infrastructure (health centers/hospitals, static and outreach immunization centers, private clinics, pharmacies, other POI).

<font size="4", class="left"> The listing exercise was carried out in 11 of the 19 Districts.

4 of the 11 districts were the RCT branches.A total of 330,055 households were listed so far, with [26%(87,691) ]{style="color:red"} of the households having no consent given. 

Majority of these are from Wakiso district(51%) </font>

## Distances & Proximity 

<font size="3"> 
The average distance from a VHT to a family/ client is 499m where as from a client to a health facility, it is 558m.
VHTs in Mbale travel the shortest distances(297m) to their clients as opposed to Sironko(729m) given the mountainous nature of the district.
On average clients in Iganga travel longer distances to reach the nearest Health facility whereas those in Mityana are much closer to the facilities
