# Objectives of the Exercise.


-   To systematically list and capture key geographic, demographic, social and health indicators across all households in each village.

-   To define village boundaries to facilitate generation of shape files by collecting GPS points around all village boundaries.

-   To establish the household coverage in the villages where LG operates.

-   To conduct a validation of attended priority households against all priority households in the community.

-   To capture relevant points of interest (POI) in each community including the location of VHT and relevant infrastructure (health centers/hospitals, static and outreach immunization centers, private clinics, pharmacies, other POI).

The listing exercise was carried out in 11 of the 19 Districts. 4 of the 11 districts were the RCT branches.A total of 330,055 households were listed so far, with [26%(87,691) ]{style="color:red"} of the households having no consent given. Majority of these are from Wakiso district(51%)
